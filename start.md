#### Carl didnt have to drive, just enjoy the journey. All he had to do was request his driver to take him to Los Santos. 
#### Similarly, you just have to request an API to do a particular task, it will do it for you, and send a response/ data to you.
#### If you notice, now driver work is completed. Its upto Carl, what he want to do there. Similarly, after receiving response, its upto you, what you would do with the responses/ data.
